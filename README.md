# Writing a notes app using MongoDB

This is the result of following an 
[excellent tutorial](https://pub.scotch.io/@mwaleh/how-to-build-a-notes-app-using-django-and-mongodb) from [scotch.io](scotch.io)
on how to build a working note taking app with Django and a MongoDB cloud server. 

Further adaption should allow a user to edit and delete notes, in addition to setting reminders and creating tags for easy indexing.
